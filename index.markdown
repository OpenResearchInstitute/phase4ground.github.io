# About

Phase 4 is an open source amateur radio project. Our goal is to
provide both designs and equipment for a radio that will operate with
a 5GHz uplink and a 10GHz downlink. Our mission is to provide an open
source [implementation](https://github.com/phase4ground/dvb_fpga) of
[DVB-S2](https://www.dvb.org/standards/dvb-s2) and
[DVB-S2X](https://www.dvb.org/standards/dvb-s2x) for both satellite
and terrestrial amateur radio use. The reference design will be in
[GNU Radio](https://www.gnuradio.org/), and a variety of radio
recipes will be published. These solutions range from DIY to something
you can purchase off-the-shelf. Phase 4 radios are intended to be
reusable and reconfigurable, supporting payloads at GEO (Phase 4B),
HEO (Phase 3E), and beyond
([Cube Quest Challenge](http://www.nasa.gov/cubequest/details)).
Additionally, these radios will work as terrestrial
microwave stations. [Groundsats](groundsat.html) on
mountaintops or towers establish a fun and flexible digital microwave
experience.

# The Hard Part

Developing a radio system is a big challenge. The most difficult part
is the software that allows this level of flexibility. The challenges
are up and down the stack, from the low-level FPGA RFNoC blocks that
we have committed to help develop up to the user interface that
doesn't get in your way. This is a substantial effort that will take a
wide variety of people and skillsets to accomplish.

# The Easy Part

It's a golden age! Digital communications engineering has never been
as fun and full of possibilities as it is right now. There are so many
powerful parts, support, research, and tools available. Take your pick
ranging from a multitude of SDRs to inexpensive development boards to
integrated developement environments. Books, videos, free and low-cost
classes, supportive communities, and amazing clubs and organizations
are literally at your fingertips. Being part of the embedded
processing world right now, and especially being part of the
explosions of digital communications, is an adventure well worth your
time. Yes, it's hard work, but it's completely worth it!
