## Github
All [documents](/docs/), software, and resources can be found in our two organizational Github accounts.

Most of the things you're likely to be looking for are in [phase4ground](https://github.com/phase4ground). Some of the items specific to the space segment are in [phase4space](https://github.com/phase4space).

Github sorts the most recently updated repositories to the top. Most repositories have a single lead contributor, and you can find out who that person is by clicking on the list of commits.

We're working on setting up issue trackers for each of these components to help with onboarding of newcomers, but for now please reach out to the lead contributor.

## Trello boards

Over-arching project tasks are added, managed, and closed out. These boards are managed by Michelle Thompson (see contacts below).
