# Phase 4 website

To work on this website locally, you need to clone the repository first.

You'll also need Ruby installed on your computer. Then you'll want to install jekyll and bundler. You may also need webrick depending on your Ruby version.

    gem install jekyll bundler webrick

From the repository's main directory, you can start the webserver with

    bundle exec jekyll serve

Then browse to http://localhost:4000.

The base jekyll setup is in the jekyll branch.
