# Frequently Asked Questions

This page will help you find documents and information about Phase 4.

## What is Phase 4?  I thought I heard something about the Germans giving us a satellite, is that Phase 4?

## Why can't we just do another AO-10/13/40 style satellite?

## When is the launch?

Expected answer is that the current best guess as of &lt;date-you-are-writing-this&gt; is that the launch will be &lt;launch-date-year-quarter&gt; but that this is likely/not-likely/certainly going to change.

## When can I use the satellite?  How long after launch will it be available to amateurs?

## What are the uplink/downlink bands (note: bands, not exact frequencies)?

## Why do we have to use those uplink/downlink bands?

## Why isn't &lt;my-favorite-band-that-I-already-have-radios-for&gt; going to be used on this satellite?

## Can I work this satellite with my HT?

## How much is it going to cost me to get the right kind of radios to use this satellite?  What kind of antennas do I need?

## Can someone explain to me if this is going to have an analog or a digital transponder?  Can I actually talk to people or will this be another beep-sat?

## What is this ARAP thing?

ARAP allows legacy radios to communicate through Phase 4 Ground radio networks. ARAPs are repeaters for Phase 4 Ground.

## How far will I be able to work DX / what is the foot print going to be?

## It's geostationary/geosynchronous/geo-what? Really? Where is the satellite going to be in the sky when viewed from my house?

## What do you mean that the footprint isn't going to change from minute-to-minute like every other amateur satellite?  How much do you think the footprint will move per day? per year?

## How long will this satellite be alive / how long will it keep working?

## Where are we at with this project?  How far along is this project? Is it done yet?

## What does the project need help with?  What skills are needed? How can I help make this happen?

## If Qatar or some other country launches a satellite will we be able to cross-link/connect the two satellite together to work further DX?

## Will I be able to collect telemetry? How? What kind of telemetry will be sent down?  What kind of equipment will I need so that I can collect telemetry?
