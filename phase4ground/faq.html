        <br />
        
        <p>What is Phase 4?  I thought I heard something about the Germans
giving us a satellite, is that Phase 4?

<p>Why can't we just do another AO-10/13/40 style satellite?
<p>When is the launch?  Expected answer is that the current best guess
as of <date-you-are-writing-this> is that the launch will be
<launch-date-year-quarter> but that this is
likely/not-likely/certainly going to change.
<p>When can I use the satellite?  How long after launch will it be
available to amateurs?
<p>What are the uplink/downlink bands (note: bands, not exact frequencies)?
<p>Why do we have to use those uplink/downlink bands?
<p>Why isn't <my-favorite-band-that-I-already-have-radios-for> going to
be used on this satellite?
<p>Can I work this satellite with my HT?
<p>How much is it going to cost me to get the right kind of radios to
use this satellite?  What kind of antennas do I need?
<p>Can someone explain to me if this is going to have an analog or a
digital transponder?  Can I actually talk to people or will this be
another beep-sat?
<p>What is this ARAP thing?
<p>How far will I be able to work DX / what is the foot print going to be?
<p>It's geostationary/geosynchronous/geo-what? Really? Where is the
satellite going to be in the sky when viewed from my house?
<p>What do you mean that the footprint isn't going to change from
minute-to-minute like every other amateur satellite?  How much do you
think the footprint will move per day? per year?
<p>How long will this satellite be alive / how long will it keep working ?
<p>Where are we at with this project?  How far along is this project ?
Is it done yet?
<p>What does the project need help with?  What skills are needed? How
can I help make this happen?
<p>If Qatar or some other country launches a satellite will we be able
to cross-link/connect the two satellite together to work further DX?
<p>Will I be able to collect telemetry? How? What kind of telemetry will
be sent down?  What kind of equipment will I need so that I can
collect telemetry?     
<p><h3>Oh, you wanted answers too...</h3>
